## Learning Objectives - Students will be able to.. 
* Describe a tuple as being a type that groups multiple values into a single compound value.
* Explain that values within a tuple can be of any type and do not have to be of the same type as each other.
* Iterate over the key-value pairs in a dictionary where each item is returned as a (key, value) tuple.
* Create a tuple and name the individual elements


## What the Student Already Knows
* Create variables and constants
* Is familiar with type annotations, type inference and string interpolation.
* Can create functions with return types.
* Is familiar with the String, Int, Double, and Bool type.
* Can perform arithmetic operations on Int and Double.
* Understands if and else clause statements.
* Can create and use Arrays.
* Can iterate over an Array using a for-in loop.
* Can iterate over an Array calling enumerate().
* Work with the following methods on arrays:
	* append()
	* insert(_:atIndex:)
	* removeAtIndex()
	* subscript syntax with arrays
	* count
	* isEmpty
	* Optionals

## Outline/ Notes

* Start with the known- students know how to iterate over arrays. Show an example of iterating over an array. 
* Before diving into an explicit definition of what a tuple is, it's important for the student to understand the problem they are solving. This can be done by providing a real world example/metaphor they can relate to... or if it's showing them code, it's showing them something they are aware of first.

```swift
let myFavoriteStarWarsFilms = [
    "Star Wars - Episode I",
    "Star Wars - Episode II",
    "Star Wars - Episode III"
]

for movie in myFavoriteStarWarsFilms {
    print("I love \(movie).")
}

// I love Star Wars - Episode I.
// I love Star Wars - Episode II.
// I love Star Wars - Episode III.
```

* Then showing them something like this:

```swift
let favoriteDirectorAndTheirFilm = [
    "George Lucas": "Star Wars: Episode I",
    "Martin Brest": "Gigli",
    "Andy Fickman": "Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2"
]
```

* Now, posing the question to the student... what happens if we iterate over the `favoriteDirectorAndTheirFilm` variable which is a dictionary of type [`String`: `String`] like we did with the `myFavoriteStarWarsFilms` array?

* Present some real world problem such as, “If you have a dictionary where the keys represent the seasons and the values represent your favorite color associated with that season, is there an easy way to print out a list that for each sentence and color that says “In the {season} my favorite color is {color}.”
    - If you have a better example feel free to use it, but always aim for a real world example. And you can use that example throughout the rest of your reading and/or use other new examples. 
    * The answer is tuples and this sets the stage for writing the content that covers your learning objectives above.--- You can iterate over the key-value pairs in a dictionary with a for-in loop. Each item in the dictionary is returned as a (key, value) tuple. Explain how you can decompose the tuple’s members into temporary constants as part of the iteration.
    
```swift
let seasonFavColors = [
    "Winter": "White",
    "Spring": "Green",
    "Summer": "Blue",
    "Fall": "Orange"
]
for (season, color) in seasonFavColors {
    print("In the \(season), my favorite color is \(color)")
}
```

* Think about why you would want to create you own tuple. (Typically it would be when you want to return multiple types from a function. Try to be creative and think of a concrete example.) This sets the stage for explaining how to create a tuple. Create a tuple where they name the individual elements when it is defined.
